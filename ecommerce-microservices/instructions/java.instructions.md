# Java Development

## General Instructions

- First, prompt the user if they want to integrate static analysis tools (SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle)
  into their project setup. If yes, provide guidance on tool selection and configuration.
- If the user declines static analysis tools or wants to proceed without them, continue with implementing the Best practices, bug patterns and code smell prevention guidelines outlined below.
- Address code smells proactively during development rather than accumulating technical debt.
- Focus on readability, maintainability, and performance when refactoring identified issues.
- Use IDE / Code editor reported warnings and suggestions to catch common patterns early in development.

## Best practices

- **Records**: For classes primarily intended to store data (e.g., DTOs, immutable data structures), **Java Records should be used instead of traditional classes**.
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilize pattern matching for `instanceof` and `switch` expression to simplify conditional logic and type casting.
- **Type Inference**: Use `var` for local variable declarations to improve readability, but only when the type is explicitly clear from the right-hand side of the expression.
- **Immutability**: Favor immutable objects. Make classes and fields `final` where possible. Use collections from `List.of()`/`Map.of()` for fixed data. Use `Stream.toList()` to create immutable lists.
- **Streams and Lambdas**: Use the Streams API and lambda expressions for collection processing. Employ method references (e.g., `stream.map(Foo::toBar)`).
- **Null Handling**: Avoid returning or accepting `null`. Use `Optional<T>` for possibly-absent values and `Objects` utility methods like `equals()` and `requireNonNull()`.

### Naming Conventions

- Follow Google's Java style guide:
  - `UpperCamelCase` for class and interface names.
  - `lowerCamelCase` for method and variable names.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - `lowercase` for package names.
- Use nouns for classes (`UserService`) and verbs for methods (`getUserById`).
- Avoid abbreviations and Hungarian notation.

### Spring Boot Best Practices
- Use **@RestController** for REST endpoints
- Use **@Service** for business logic
- Use **@Repository** for data access layer
- Use **@Entity** for JPA entities
- Prefer **constructor injection** over field injection
- Use **@Validated** for input validation
- Use **ResponseEntity** for HTTP responses with proper status codes
- Use **@Transactional** for database transactions

## API Design Guidelines

### REST Conventions
- Use **plural nouns** for resource endpoints: `/api/products`, `/api/orders`
- Use **HTTP methods** appropriately: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Use **proper HTTP status codes**: 200, 201, 400, 404, 500
- Use **consistent response format** for all endpoints
- Implement **pagination** for list endpoints
- Use **query parameters** for filtering and sorting

## Database Conventions

### JPA Entities
- Use **@Entity** and **@Table** annotations
- Always include **@Id** and **@GeneratedValue**
- Use **@Column** for custom column mappings
- Use **@CreatedDate** and **@LastModifiedDate** for auditing
- Implement **equals()** and **hashCode()** for entities

### Relationships
- Use **@OneToMany**, **@ManyToOne**, **@ManyToMany** appropriately
- Use **FetchType.LAZY** by default
- Use **@JoinColumn** for foreign key mappings
- Avoid **bidirectional relationships** unless necessary

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication
- Implement **role-based access control** with Spring Security
- Use **@PreAuthorize** for method-level security
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use **BCrypt** for password hashing

### Data Protection
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal data)
- Use **@JsonIgnore** for password fields
- Implement **input validation** on all endpoints
- Use **HTTPS** for all communications

## Microservices Patterns

### Service Communication
- Prefer **REST APIs** for synchronous communication
- Use **message queues** (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication
- Implement **circuit breaker** pattern for fault tolerance
- Use **service discovery** (Eureka) for service registration

### Configuration
- Use **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized configuration
- Use **@ConfigurationProperties** for typed configuration
- Externalize environment-specific values
- Use **profiles** for different environments (dev, test, prod)

## Error Handling

### Exception Handling
- Create **custom exceptions** for business logic errors
- Use **@ControllerAdvice** for global exception handling
- Return **meaningful error messages** to clients
- Log errors with **appropriate log levels**

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Use **JUnit 5** for unit tests
- Use **Mockito** for mocking dependencies
- Test **business logic** in service classes
- Use **@MockBean** for Spring Boot tests
- Aim for **90%+ code coverage**

### Integration Testing
- Use **@SpringBootTest** for integration tests
- Use **TestContainers** for database testing
- Test **complete API workflows**
- Use **@Transactional** with **@Rollback** for test data cleanup

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Use **@Cacheable** for expensive operations
- Use **Redis** for distributed caching
- Cache **frequently accessed data** (products, user sessions)
- Implement **cache invalidation** strategies

### Database Optimization
- Use **database indexes** for frequently queried fields
- Implement **connection pooling**
- Use **pagination** for large datasets
- Optimize **N+1 query problems** with **@EntityGraph**


### Bug Patterns

| Rule ID | Description                                                 | Example / Notes                                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `S2095` | Resources should be closed                                  | Use try-with-resources when working with streams, files, sockets, etc.                           |
| `S1698` | Objects should be compared with `.equals()` instead of `==` | Especially important for Strings and boxed primitives.                                           |
| `S1905` | Redundant casts should be removed                           | Clean up unnecessary or unsafe casts.                                                            |
| `S3518` | Conditions should not always evaluate to true or false      | Watch for infinite loops or if-conditions that never change.                                     |
| `S108`  | Unreachable code should be removed                          | Code after `return`, `throw`, etc., must be cleaned up.                                          |

## Code Smells

| Rule ID | Description                                            | Example / Notes                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S107`  | Methods should not have too many parameters            | Refactor into helper classes or use builder pattern.                          |
| `S121`  | Duplicated blocks of code should be removed            | Consolidate logic into shared methods.                                        |
| `S138`  | Methods should not be too long                         | Break complex logic into smaller, testable units.                             |
| `S3776` | Cognitive complexity should be reduced                 | Simplify nested logic, extract methods, avoid deep `if` trees.                |
| `S1192` | String literals should not be duplicated               | Replace with constants or enums.                                              |
| `S1854` | Unused assignments should be removed                   | Avoid dead variablesâ€”remove or refactor.                                      |
| `S109`  | Magic numbers should be replaced with constants        | Improves readability and maintainability.                                     |
| `S1188` | Catch blocks should not be empty                       | Always log or handle exceptions meaningfully.                                 |
