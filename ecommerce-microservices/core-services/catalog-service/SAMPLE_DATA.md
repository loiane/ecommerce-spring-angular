## Product-Category Relationships
- All products are properly associated with their respective categories via the `product_categories` join table
- Each product belongs to exactly one category (though the system supports many-to-many relationships)
- Category hierarchy is properly maintained with parent-child relationships

## API Endpoints Verified

âœ… **Categories:**
- `GET /api/categories` - Lists all categories with pagination
- `GET /api/categories/search?name=Electronics` - Search categories by name
- Categories show proper parent relationships

âœ… **Products:**
- `GET /api/products` - Lists all products with pagination
- `GET /api/products/search?name=iPhone` - Search products by name
- Products include proper category associations
- All product fields populated (SKU, name, slug, brand, description, status)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Features Used:
- **UUID Primary Keys** - All entities use UUIDs for better scalability
- **Proper Foreign Key Relationships** - Categories have parent_id references, products linked via junction table
- **Timestamping** - All entities have created_at and updated_at fields
- **Database Constraints** - SKU uniqueness, slug format validation, status value constraints
- **Indexes** - Performance indexes on searchable fields

### Migration Features:
- **Flyway Migration** - V2__sample_data.sql follows proper naming convention
- **Incremental** - Applied automatically after V1 schema creation
- **Production Ready** - Uses explicit UUIDs for consistency across environments
- **Rollback Safe** - Can be reverted if needed

## Testing Results

ðŸŸ¢ **Application Startup:** Success - Flyway applied migration v2 successfully
ðŸŸ¢ **Categories API:** Working - Returns sample categories with proper hierarchy
ðŸŸ¢ **Products API:** Working - Returns sample products with category associations
ðŸŸ¢ **Search Functionality:** Working - Both category and product search operational
ðŸŸ¢ **Data Integrity:** Verified - All relationships and constraints working properly

## Next Steps
The sample data provides a solid foundation for:
1. Integration testing
2. Frontend development and testing
3. API documentation examples
4. Performance testing with realistic data
5. Demonstration purposes

The data covers diverse product types and category structures that represent a real e-commerce catalog, enabling comprehensive testing of all catalog service features.
